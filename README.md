# Analyze International Debt Statistics (Guided by DataCamp)
**In this project, I am going to analyze my data using PostgreSQL to find out the distinct debt indicators, the number of distinct countries, the total amount of debt owed by the countries, country with the highest debt, average amount of debt across indicators, the highest amount of principal repayments, the most common debt indicator,...**

## 1. Questions to answer
- What is the total amount of debt that is owed by the countries listed in the dataset?
- Which country owns the maximum amount of debt and what does that amount look like?
- What is the average amount of debt owed by countries across different debt indicators?

## 2. Highlighted components 
- KEYWORDS: SELECT(), LIMIT, SELECT DISTINCT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, WHERE
- AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS: COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), MAX()

## 3. Dataset
The data used in this project is collected by [The World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home). It presents debt statistics (in USD) from several nations recorded from 1970 to 2015.
